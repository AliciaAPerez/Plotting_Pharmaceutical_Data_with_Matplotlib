## Overview
The code gives a lot of information which can be viewed in the code and in the images folder. From the graphs we can see that there is a strong positive correlation for average tumor volume and the mouse weight when using the Capomulin regimen. With a single mouse we see there's a negative trend over time in which the tumor volume decreases while using Capomulin.
